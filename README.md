# Speech Recognition and Transcription

## Description

This Python script uses the `speech_recognition` library to recognize and translate speech from an audio file and writes the transcribed text to a text file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` library
- `pydub` library (for handling various audio file formats)
- `ffmpeg` or `libav` (for audio format conversion if necessary)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pydub
```

For handling audio file formats, you also need ffmpeg or libav. On Windows, you can download and install ffmpeg from FFmpeg's official website.
1. Download the FFmpeg executable for Windows.
2. Extract the contents and place the bin folder in a directory.
3. Add the path to the bin folder to your system's PATH environment variable.

## Usage
Place your audio file at the desired location. Ensure the file path is correctly specified in the script.
Update the audio_file_path and output_file_path variables in the script if needed.
Run the script:
```bash
python transcribe_audio.py
```

The script will read the audio file, transcribe the speech to text, and save the output to a text file.

## Example
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    audio_file_path = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\Recording.m4a"
    output_file_path = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\Transcription.txt"
    transcribe_audio_to_text(audio_file_path, output_file_path)
```
This will transcribe the audio from Recording.m4a and save the text to Transcription.txt.

Ensure the audio file format is supported. If not, convert the audio file to a compatible format (e.g., WAV) using ffmpeg.
The script uses Google Web Speech API for recognition, which requires an internet connection.
